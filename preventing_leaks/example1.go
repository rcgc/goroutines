	1) Here we pass the done channel to
	the doWork function. As a convention, this
	channel is the first parameter.

	2) On this line we see the ubiquitous
	for-select pattern in use. One of our
	case statements is checking whether our
	done channel has been signaled. If it has,
	we return from the goroutine.

	3) Here we create another goroutine that
	will cancel the goroutine spawned in doWork
	if more than one second passes.

	4) This is where we join the goroutine spawned
	from doWork with the main goroutine.
